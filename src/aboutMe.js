        <p>
          Hello World! Im Dev the Dev! I'm currently a Front-end developer
          aspiring to become a Full-stack developer. For the past couple of
          years I have been working in fashion & marketing alongside some pretty
          amazing artists at Interscope Records. From managing their social
          pages to organzing their personal wardrobes, I have thouroughly
          enjoyed my growth there! As an artistic person, I appreciate and love
          all things creative. I was introduced into programming and its
          creative aspect while working with a co-worker on a web application.
          This helped me make the transition and take a leap of faith into
          learning programming.{' '}
